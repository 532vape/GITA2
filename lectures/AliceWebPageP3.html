	<strong>Alice was beginning to get very tired of 
	sitting by her sister on the bank,</strong> and of
	having nothing to do: once or twice she had
	peeped into the book her sister was reading, 
	but it had no pictures or conversations in 
	it, "and what is the use of a book, "
	thought Alice, "without pictures or 
	conversations?"
